    TypeMismatch: Cannot convert *string to string
    It is unclear how nil should be handled in the pointer to non pointer conversion.

    You can enable useZeroValueOnPointerInconsistency to instruct goverter to use the zero value if source is nil
    https://goverter.jmattheis.de/reference/useZeroValueOnPointerInconsistency

    or you can define a custom conversion method with extend:
